      <p>Choreographer Hooman Sharifi (NO) was born in Tehran in 1973 and came alone to Norway at the <br>
        age of 15. He began his dance career as a teenager with hip-hop and later continued with classical and modern ballet,<br>
         earning a degree in choreography from the Oslo National Academy of the Arts. He is particularly interested in the  <br>
         intersection of dance, theater, and visual arts. In 2000, he founded his own company, Impure Company, which focuses on <br>
         social engagement and has since created over 30 choreographic works. Sharifi's movement language is physically <br>
         exhausting, intense, and powerful, exploring the structures behind hierarchies, power, political systems, and violence. <br>
        From 2014 to 2018, he was the artistic director of Norway's national contemporary dance company, Carte Blanche. <br>
        Sharifi collaborates with many major institutions, and his works have achieved great international success.</p>
